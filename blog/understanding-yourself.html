                        <div class="blog-content">
                            <h1 id="understanding-yourself">Understanding Yourself</h1>
<p>So I was looking back at my life choices and was trying to understand why I am able to sail through without feeling burdened by the things I do. This mostly led myself to think around two main things, interest and not wanting to stay where I am.</p>
<h2 id="finding-what-you-love">Finding What You Love</h2>
<p>I will be honest, it was mainly luck on my part that I found what I love to do, although I was attracted to computers way before e.g. starting blogs to train people how to make computer virus, playing game, sometimes even trying to make games. Yes I enjoyed it but even with it I didn't really thought that I should pursue computer science.</p>
<p>Far from that, I am not really interested in cyber security, or game development. It's just random work for me but it's a passion for some people and some people really enjoy that! So there goes my point, I was lucky. Instead of choosing to go for doctor, I went for an engineer (although I expressed my interest in becoming a doctor initially) AND I didn't really liked the studies that I did for getting into engineering. It's just I coincidentally took Computer Science in my junior college and there we go.</p>
<h2 id="the-natural-fit">The Natural Fit</h2>
<p>I got interested in it mainly at the time when I topped my junior college for Computer Science while almost failing for the other subjects. It's like this for me, if I don't like something no matter how attractive that might be, I won't do it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digressing a bit since these are just my thoughts I am laying out here, I always tell my friends do not do anything if you don't find value in it. Do not do anything if you are not compensated enough for it. If you are getting undercompensated, you might do that for yourself instead of someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But yeah getting back to my point, I enjoyed computer science, I found it easy for me like natural.</p>
<h2 id="the-drive-to-grow">The Drive to Grow</h2>
<p>It was easy to understand different concepts in it, dig into different things and grasp new concepts. I was actively reading about different domains in computer science. So yeah, I think its very important to find something that you would love to do. You won't get bored doing.</p>
<p>Another thing that compelled me for not staying complacent was the fact that I didn't want to be poor. Yeah, they are facts. I never got a bit jealous when looking at rich people earning more, I was like yeah they deserve it. They did it by themselves and this is how the world works and should work. So I didn't want to stay in the same position very badly.</p>
<h2 id="impact-beyond-yourself">Impact Beyond Yourself</h2>
<p>This thought process compelled me to understand how I can get out of my current state and make an impact on my life. This is good enough right? Well it becomes more complicated. When you try to grow yourself, like real growth you start thinking things through a different lens. Initially my thoughts were I'll earn lots of money that's it. But when you look deeper you find that your choices can impact peoples life. Your choices can impact how the world works, how people live and that is an important consideration to make.</p>
<p>You need to become someone capable enough to be a support system for others not just for yourself. With that you will become more accomplished definitely but along that you will also help others to contribute to the society.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I mean this is a very deep statement and this text is not a refined version of my thoughts, just some random draft about what I think, my personal opinions and not a burnished ones at that.</p>
