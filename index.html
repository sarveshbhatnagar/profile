						<h2>Hello There!</h2>
						<p>I am Sarvesh Bhatnagar, an individual with great interest in coding & research. If you would
							ask me
							to describe myself in 3 words I would say, "inquisitive, growth-oriented, coder". A detailed
							explanation for
							why is given here <href
								a="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6859897458231709697/">LinkedIn
								Post</href>
							Although there are not many likes to that post, I am sure you will find it interesting.
						</p>
						<p>I have a strong inclination towards learning something new, my specialty lies in burnishing
							my abilities, leading a group of people evident in the organization formed by me and my peer
							named Project Drive, Teaching and getting things done. </p>
						<p>
							<b>Ongoing Works:</b>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>SDE </strong> at Amazon.</li>
							<li>Understanding challenges with LLM for Human Interaction by creating Interview Platform</li>
						</ol>
						<ol>
							<b>Things I go by:</b>
							<li>Consistent Reading and writing habit: A man who can read and write is dangerous.</li>
							<li>Self Reflection: Apparently most people either don't know about what they don't know or
								they don't know what they know. Don't be that person!</li>
							<li>Confident Humility: Being confident that you can do something yet knowing you don't know
								a lot of things is important. I don't know a lot of things yet, I know I will get there
								though! </li>
							<li>Self Worth: Know your value, never go below that!</li>

										<p> This was an exciting and amazing experience. I got to learn so much just in

											Amazon in general focuses on their Leadership principles a lot and rightly
											so! My main growth areas were
											thinking backwards (Customer Obsession), Insist on highest standards, Biased
											for action and Learn and be curious.
											Furthermore, the culture you get when working at Amazon is very beneficial
											to your growth: Your Manager, Mentor and Co-workers are all rooting for that
											and guide you towards
											being your better self. I would definitely recommend everyone who get a
											chance to actually strive for SDE at Amazon because it is one of the best
											company to work at when taking
											your growth into consideration. You just learn a lot. BTW, I am returning at
											Amazon this October. Also, some of the other interns are really smart as
											well.

											are in the wrong group!)
